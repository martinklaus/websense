Project Notes TODO Aug/Sep 2011:

0. Learn php, javascript, html, postgres, and map apis (googelemaps and openstreetmaps)

1. Network Health Display:
  - show latest state of each node - for example see "quick overview statistics" for CSIRO app at http://150.229.98.68/deployments
for example http://150.229.98.68/stats/63

2. Display Heatmap to show instantaneous (or animated) readings (eg all temperature or all soil moisture for a site).  See wa.temp.heatmap.gif and kingspark.heatmap.  Consider animated heat map if time.

3. OpenStreetMaps Markers: Use openstreetmaps API to add node markers to maps (as for google maps in websense) 
see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page

4. Interaction for User Provided Maps:  Support markers and dynamic browsing for user-provided maps (eg for Heidelberg NIZ) - possibly using openstreetmaps

5. Web site robustness: apply checks and test web site in different browsers
